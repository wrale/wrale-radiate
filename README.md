# Wrale Radiate

Global Display Manager - Steel Thread Implementation

Wrale Radiate is a digital signage management system built to handle video content distribution across multiple displays. This repository contains a steel thread implementation that proves the core workflow.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Upload and distribute video content
- ‚úÖ Real-time display health monitoring
- ‚úÖ Basic display simulation
- ‚úÖ Content delivery verification

## System Overview

The implementation demonstrates four core capabilities:

1. Content Management (MKTG_CONTENT_MGMT)
   - Upload video content via web interface
   - Track content delivery status
   - Manage content lifecycle

2. Content Transport (CAP_CONTENT_TRANSPORT)
   - Reliable content delivery to displays
   - Real-time content distribution
   - WebSocket-based updates

3. Basic Rendering (CAP_BASIC_RENDER)
   - H.264 video playback
   - Display status reporting
   - Automated content updates

4. Health Monitoring (CAP_DISPLAY_HEALTH)
   - Real-time display health tracking
   - Content playback verification
   - Connection status monitoring

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and docker-compose OR
- Podman and podman-compose

### Quick Start

```bash
# First time setup
make init
make up
make open

# Or use the cycle command
make cycle    # Clean, pull latest, init, and start
```

This will start:
- Management Interface: http://localhost:3000
- Display Simulator: http://localhost:3001
- MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadmin)

### Key Commands

```bash
# View all logs
make logs

# View specific logs
make webapp-logs
make display-logs

# Access shells
make shell-webapp
make shell-display

# Cleanup
make down     # Stop services
make clean    # Full cleanup
```
