# 2024-03-14 Initial ANDA Documentation Structure

## Change
Established Actor-Needs Driven Architecture documentation structure with:
- actors/
- resources/
- interactions/
- states/
- decisions/

## Motivation
- Need clear traceability from architecture to actor needs
- Support future architectural evolution
- Enable clear decision tracking

## Key Decisions
1. REST-like resource hierarchy
2. Consistent README.md at each level
3. Maximum depth of 2 levels
4. Separation of concerns by directory

## Impact
- Provides clear documentation structure
- Establishes patterns for future changes
- Makes architectural decisions explicit

## Initial Architecture
- Hybrid content distribution approach
- Manifest-based synchronization
- Long-poll status channel
- Local content caching
