# Steel Thread Documentation

This documentation focuses on the core steel thread. All other documentation has been removed or simplified to maintain focus on the essential flow:

1. Store an asset (MKTG â†’ ASSET_LIB)
2. Get it to a display (TRANSPORT)
3. Show it correctly (BASIC_RENDER)
4. Know if it worked (HEALTH)

See the actors/ and capabilities/ directories for implementation details.
