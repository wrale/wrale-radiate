# Architectural Decisions

Key architectural decisions made in the Wrale Radiate system design.

## Core Decisions

### [Distribution](distribution/)
How we chose to move content through the system.

### [Monitoring](monitoring/)
How we handle status tracking and reporting.

## Decision Making Process

All architectural decisions follow these principles:

1. Actor Need Driven
   - Every decision serves specific actor needs
   - Complexity must be justified by needs
   - Simpler solutions preferred

2. Future Proof
   - Document what makes decision obsolete
   - Plan for evolution
   - Avoid lock-in

3. Pragmatic
   - Consider real-world constraints
   - Account for failure modes
   - Balance ideals with practicality
