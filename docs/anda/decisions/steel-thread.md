# Steel Thread Architecture Decisions

## Core Philosophy
Implement the simplest possible path for content flow with status confirmation

## Key Decisions

### 1. Simple Content Flow
- Direct path from storage to display
- Minimal intermediary processing
- Basic content formats only

### 2. Basic Health Monitoring
- Essential status metrics
- Simple delivery confirmation
- Basic issue detection

### 3. Implementation Approach
- Start with simplest working implementation
- Avoid premature optimization
- Enable future evolution without overengineering

## Future Considerations
- Additional display types
- Advanced scheduling
- Enhanced monitoring
- Content workflows
- Edge computing

All future additions should build upon this core steel thread.
